 2.1 Prepare the Organization (PO) for the Build and Deploy CI/CD Steps
---


### 2.1 Prepare the Organization (PO) Build and Deploy Tasks
Organizations should ensure that their people, processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the organization level. Many organizations will find some PO practices to also be applicable to subsets of their software development, like individual development groups or projects.

<br>

**PO.1**
<strong>Define Security Requirements for Software Development</strong>: Ensure that security requirements for software development are known at all times so that they can be taken into account throughout the SDLC and duplication of effort can be minimized because the requirements information can be collected once and shared. This includes requirements from internal sources (e.g., the organization’s policies, business objectives, and risk  management strategy) and external sources (e.g., applicable laws and regulations).

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.1 in a Build and Deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts from just defining to:

- Enforcing security policies on dependencies, code, and configurations.

- Verifying compliance with established security baselines before deployment.

- Ensuring artifacts meet DoD, NIST, or organizational security requirements.

**PO.2**

<strong>Implement Roles and Responsibilities: </strong> Ensure that everyone inside and outside of the organization involved in the SDLC is prepared to perform their SDLC-related roles and responsibilities throughout the SDLC. 

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.2 in a Build and Deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Enforcing role-based access control (RBAC) to limit who can trigger builds, approve changes, and deploy.

- Providing audit logs and traceability of actions for accountability.

- Ensuring code changes and deployments are reviewed by authorized personnel.

**PO.3**

<strong>Implement Supporting Toolchains</strong>: Use automation to reduce human effort and improve the accuracy, reproducibility, usability, and comprehensiveness of security practices throughout the SDLC, as well as provide a way to document and demonstrate the use of these
practices. Toolchains and tools may be used at different levels of the organization, such as organization-wide or project-specific, and may address a particular part of the SDLC, like a build pipeline.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.3 in a Build and Deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Ensuring build and deployment tools are configured securely and kept patched.

- Protecting against supply chain attacks targeting the CI/CD pipeline.

- Verifying the integrity of tools and artifacts before use.

- Controlling and monitoring access to toolchains.

**PO.4**
<strong>Define and Use Criteria for Software Security Checks:</strong> Help ensure that the software resulting from the SDLC meets the organization’s expectations by defining and using criteria for checking the software’s security during development.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.4 in a Build and Deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Applying consistent security testing and validation practices before release.

- Automating security checks in CI/CD pipelines.

- Using standardized processes for verifying, signing, and tracking artifacts.

- Integrating security gates so no insecure artifact is deployed.

**PO.5**
<strong>Implement and Maintain Secure Environments for Software Development:</strong> Ensure that all components of the environments for software development are strongly protected from internal and external threats to prevent compromises of the
environments or the software being developed or maintained within them. Examples of environments for software development include development, build, test, and distribution environments.

<br>

To satisfy SSDF PO.5 in a Build and Deploy context using open-source tools, the focus shifts to:

- Protecting CI/CD infrastructure from internal and external threats.

- Hardening build servers, container registries, and deployment systems.

- Ensuring build and deploy environments are patched, monitored, and access-controlled.

- Preventing malicious code or tampering in the software supply chain.
